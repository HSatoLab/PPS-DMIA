# PPS-DMIA

-This is an open source code of PPS-DMIA implemented by MATLAB.

-You can easily use this code on Evolutionary multi-objective optimization platform ([PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO)) on MATLAB.

## How to run

  1. Download [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/releases) from here.

  2. Add the PPSDMIA directory to "Algorithms/Multi-objective optimization".

  3. Run PPSDMIA in a way of PlatEMO.
