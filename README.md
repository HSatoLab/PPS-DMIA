# PPS-DMIA

-This repository provides open-source MATLAB code for PPS-DMIA.

-The code is designed to work seamlessly with the ([PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO)) platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization.

## How to run

  1. Download [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/releases).

  2. Copy the PPSDMIA directory into "Algorithms/Multi-objective optimization".

  3. Run PPSDMIA in the same manner as other algorithms in PlatEMO.
